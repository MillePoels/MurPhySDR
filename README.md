## Motivation

This project started out as an engineering assignment and isn't meant to be groundbreaking or extremely innovative. Rather, it serves as a practical way for me to learn hardware development. The assignment required us to write a [thesis](/hardware/Electronics_design_and_structure_thesis.pdf) describing our endeavor, so I included it here. Keep in mind that I'm Belgian so it's written in Dutch.
